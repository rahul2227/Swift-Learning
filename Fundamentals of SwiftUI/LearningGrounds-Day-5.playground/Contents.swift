// Curious Find - Swift supports all sorts of complex strings – literally every human language works out of the box, including emoji, and that just isn’t true in so many other programming languages. However, this really great support has a cost, and one part of that cost is that asking a string for its count makes Swift go through and count up all the letters one by one – it doesn’t just store its length separately from the string.

//Our little check for count == 0 has to go through and count all the letters in the string, even though as soon as we have counted at least one character we know the answer to our question.

// So a better way is

if username.isEmpty {
    username = "Anonymous"

// Behind the scenes, Swift implements this in a remarkably clever way that actually allows it to compare a wide variety of things. For example, Swift has a special type for storing dates called Date, and you can compare dates using the same operators: someDate < someOtherDate, for example.
